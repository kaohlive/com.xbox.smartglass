Interact with your Xbox using the smartglass features
It is inspired by the OpenXbox project and using their nodejs library to make it an compatible app for Homey.

With the app you can turn on and turn off your XBox One and you can use a workflow card to see what app is running on the Xbox.
The running app name is the Application User Model ID. Unfortunatly these do not translate to windows app store app id's.

Uses: https://github.com/OpenXbox/xbox-smartglass-core-node for the difficult parts of the app!
Thanks!!
